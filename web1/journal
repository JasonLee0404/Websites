============================================================================


+ create a wrapper to have the contents fixed in one width, even when the screen
size changes, the wrapper is still there in fixed width

================================================================================

when you're building website and you're not sure about color, then its good idea to make it grayscale color

we want padding because otherwise the text is right on the edge, and we don't want that

you can add it into the main area, or just section by section

in #main, set width:100% because we want to take 100% of the space

=============================================================================

Turn our unordered list into navigation bar


media queries are at the bottom of your CSS



@media screen and (min-width: 800px){
	

}




@media screen and (min-width: 800px) {
	body {
		background-color: red;
	}
}


//technically it has to be like this, but for some reason, it doesnt work that way




@media screen and (max-width: 800px) {
	body {
		background-color: blue;
	}

	nav {
		float: left;
		width: 20%;
	}
}



//Sometimes media queries is set to max width instead of min width, notice this
this means whenever you hit this threshold of screensize, the style inside
will be apply



	nav li {
		display: blocks;
		padding: 10px 20px;
		width: 100%;
	}



// this is to change the nav bar into vertical instead of horizontal
whenever the size is coming to mobile

//you can import google fonts in link html but
//you should import it with stylesheet because you're gonna be using this
//stylesheet across multiple pages for consitency
